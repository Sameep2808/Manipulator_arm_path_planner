Our objective is to create a IK solver and a path planning software for a 4D\+OF robotic arm. Today at every scale of manufacturing from minutely detailed V\+L\+SI board assembly to heavy industry such as automobile production as well as in warehouses for pick and place application, robotic arms are being used. Similarly Acme robotics can use a robotic arm for various activities once they have a software which can navigate their arm to desired location efficiently.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{Objective}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md3}
Our project focuses on the software for optimal implementation of robotic arm, with 4D\+OF robotic arm equipped with an IK solver and custom designed path planner to simulate its actions and movement in capabilities similar to a human arm for a pick and place application. This software will be developed keeping in mind the inverse kinematics and the path planning, taking into account the obstacles and complexities faced by robotic arm with any dimensions.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Approach}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md4}
Inverse Kinematic Solver\+: Inverse kinematics uses kinematics equation to get the joint parameters which then can be used to calculate the desired position and rotation of our robotic arm end-\/effectors. We use this method as it is much faster compared to the forward kinematics. There are three methods to solve inverse kinematics\+: Algebraic\+: Basically solving using matrices Geometric\+:Using robotic armâ€™s geometry with trigonometric equations Numeric\+:Take random movements and look how close we are to the target then move one or more segments to locally minimize the error. Repeat the same process till you reach the final point In this project we will be using the geometric method as it is comparatively less complex and efficient.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Importance}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md5}
Industry creates a lot of jobs which are repetitive, mundane and tedious. A human can work efficiently for 8 hours and more if trained properly but still lacks efficiency when compared to a robot. Industry has realised this and is replacing humans with robotic arms for these highly mundane jobs to increase productivity. Today at every scale of manufacturing from minutely detailed V\+L\+SI board assembly to heavy industry such as automobile production as well as in warehouses for pick and place application, robotic arms are being used. In each of these cases selection of the right robotic arm with the right inverse kinematics and path planning algorithm should be used. The software designed by us is a dynamic IK solver and path planner for a 5 D\+OF robotic arm with variable arm length as per the users requirements.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Technologies Used}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md6}
Programming language \+: C++. Build system \+: Ubuntu 18.\+04, 20.\+04 . Softwares used \+: Eclipse, Open\+GL. Libraries\+: Math library, Standard C++ Libraries.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Risk and Mitigation}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md7}
Mechanical failures may result in unexpected behaviour of the arm and such failures can cause potential damage to the system. To avoid this regular maintenance of the robot should be performed. Human errors can cause a wide range of mistakes like faulty interfacing or incorrect activation of software. To avoid these we can use exceptions while programming so that such mistakes are ignored and rectified and the program doesn\textquotesingle{}t crash while running.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Development Process}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md8}
The design and development process will be followed by the A\+IP (Agile Iterative process) model. Here programmers Yash and Sameep will write the initial code using T\+DD (Test driven development) format where Sameep will be the driver and Yash will be the Navigator for the initial phase of code development. In the phase 2 of the process the driver and navigator roles will be swapped. The role of process manager will be observed by the person in the role of navigator. Iteration meetings will be conducted and parallel code changes will be made. The product backlog will be created and it will be iterated as the project progresses. This will also ensure the quality of the project.
